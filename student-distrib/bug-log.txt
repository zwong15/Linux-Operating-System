Checkpoint #1 Bugs:

1). Loading/Using GDT:
    Had trouble figuring out where to emulate the GDT, so we could not bootup and kept triple faulting. RESOLVED: The team was incorrectly
    aligning the GDT with the IDT and the placement of it was wrong.
    TIME: 2 hours

2). Setting IDT Entries in Table:
    Exceptions were not being properly caught when triggered, specifically the device handlers. RESOLVED: Did not properly notice the definition
    given in x86 Description header file where a skeleton of an IDT entry was shown.
    TIME: 1 hours


Checkpoint #2:

3). Incorrect RTC Read:
    Was not properly waiting for another RTC interrupt to occur. RESOLVED: Fixed placement of the flag to be changed when an RTC interrupt has
    been generated.
    TIME: 1 hour

4). Not clearing the Screen:
    Was not able to clear the entire screen using the CTRL + L button combination. RESOLVED: Upon the button combination, we were not properly
    deleting the edge of the screen/border chracters.
    Time: 1 hour

5). Screen Scrolling:
    Not scrolling the window down properly. RESOLVED: Was not fully saving the entire screen
    Time: 1 hour

6). Filesystem Helper Functions:
    Did not see filesystem helper functions when creating the filesystem. It worked for this checkpoint. Unable to use with system calls.
    RESOLVED: Implemented required filesystem helper functions to successfully run system calls.
    Time: 3 hours

Checkpoint #3:

7). Executing Properly:
    Was unable to execute the shell properly on bootup. RESOLVED: Was not properly created a process from the PCB structure as well as context
    switching.
    Time: 4 hours

8). Halting:
    Was unable to halt a process as well as prevent the initial shell from halting. RESOLVED: Improperly extracting the parent process ebp and esp
    after we leave and return.
    Time: 3 hours

Checkpoint #4:

9). Verylong file error:
    When trying to read from the file, we were not able to need from the verylargetextwithaverylongname.txt file because it did not end with a NULL
    character. RESOLVED: Made a conditional statement to check if we read an entire 32 bits and return it.
    Time: 1 hour

10). User Programs Not Displaying:
     User programs, like counter, would not be displayed properly onto the screen. The numbers for the counter were not being shown, but the screen
     made the correct space for them. RESOLVED: adding an STI and CLI around the call to the system call handler.
     TIME: 2 hours

11). Getting incorrect arguments for getargs system call:
     Was getting garbage values attached to the argument passed into the getargs system call. RESOLVED: implemented a counter member in the pcb struct
     to count the argument being collected in execute.
     Time: 1.5 hours

12). Page Faulting in Vidmap:
     Page faulted when trying to run fish user program as well as the syserr test case. RESOLVED: improperly mapped the requested memory to an invalid
     location.
     Time: 1.5 hours

Checkpoint #5:

13). Page Faulting when using Multiple Terminals
     Any user program run on the three startup shells would result in a page fault. RESOLVED: We were not properly saving the EBP after the User
     program ends.
     Time: 8 hours
